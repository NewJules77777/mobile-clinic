<h2>About the Mobile Clinic Approach</h2>
<p>The mobile clinic approach is a healthcare delivery model that involves bringing essential healthcare services, including Adolescent Sexual Reproductive Health (ASRH) services, directly to communities. These mobile clinics are equipped to provide a range of services such as counseling, education, testing, and treatment, particularly targeting underserved or remote areas where access to healthcare facilities is limited</p>
